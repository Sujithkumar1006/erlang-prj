Given functions have been implemented by the given hints.

Issues faced:
   1. For id_poly_eval function tried to use Recursive local function to ConvertCoeffs but since local function was not defined already before calling the recurision faced an issue known as ConvertCoeffs is unbound.
   2. lists:zip in Eshell V14.2.4 accepts 3 arguments but in remote machine version it accepts only 2 arguments.
